## Lab: using single stepping to check interleaving.

### Errata and clarifications.

Notes:

  - If you add threads (extension): make sure you use `switchto`
    rather than `cswitch` in the exception handler. If you recall
    from past labs we've gone with the convension of having all
    exception handlers use the same stack.   Instead you should
    save the registers passed into the handler, and use a switchto
    to go from one to the other.

  - For tests that have errors: `make check` may not pass because
    you might legitimately have a different number of errors than we do.

    While checking at the machine code level makes the tool powerful,
    it also means you may not match our tests if the number of machine
    code instructions your compiler emitted for a test differs from ours.
    Currently our stance is that you'll have to look at the tests to see
    if they make sense (the pro argument for this is that it helps your
    reason about what is going on).

  - On the above note: Test 1 is not passing for a bunch of people.
    You can skip it.

  - Note: you'll have to cast-away the volatile when calling B
    from your single-step handler.  Something like:

            // call B
            if(!c->B((void*)c)) {
                ...

    This is ugly (sorry) but is safe for what we are doing today.

  - Use the tests in `code/tests` (not `code/tests-2.0`) unless you
    do extensions.  The `code-tests-2.0` require `yield()`.

  - As the `breakpoint.h` header file states: these routines will
    be very close to those in `mini-step.h` so adapting your code from
    lab 9 should be quick.  We have renamed them b/c there was some
    variations in how people built theirs b/c the lab 9 README was
    unclear on exact functionality.

  - The trylock discussion has been simplified, so look at the
    README.

### Intro


Now that you have a single-step implementation, we'll use it to for
something cool: writing a concurrency checker that is tiny but mighty.
By the end you'll be able to race condition bugs difficult to catch with
any other tool I know of.

The trick we'll play would be difficult to do on Mac or Linux, but for us
is easy --- the fact that we have a small, completely controlled system
makes it easy to add weird, powerful tricks.  This lab was a favorite
in 240lx so is a good break from our low-level death march.  It's also
good example of what you can do with OS hacks for a final project.

The basic idea: 
  1. Given two client routines A() and B() the purport to handle
     concurrency;
  2. Run `A(); B();` to get the state if they ran sequentially.
  3. Then run `A()` for 1 instruction (using single stepping):
        - switch to `B()` and run `B()` to completion;
        - switch back to `A()` and run `A()` to completion.  
        - Then check that the state is the same as in step 2.
        - If so: success.  
        - If not: bug.
  4. Run A() for 2 instructions...
  5. Run A() for 3 instructions...
  6. Stop when there are no more instructions in A() to switch on.
     
At the end you've done pre-emptive context switching on `A()` at every
single instruction and verified that you always get the same answer.
Tons of extensions!  Great for final projects.

For this lab you'll have to read the comments. Sorry :( 
  - `code/check-interleave.h`: has the the interface.
  - `code/check-interleave.c`: has a working version.
  - `code/tests/` has tests.  As usual, test 0 is easier than test 1 etc.
    You should look at the tests to see how the tool works.

Checkoff:
 1. Do part 1 and part 2.   
 2. Implement `breakpoint.h` and make sure you get the same results
    as ours (should be trivial adaptation from last lab).
 3. Add a couple non-ridiculous ai-generated tests and find bugs (or not
    if it gets it right!)
 4. Ideally (but not required) do part 3 and 4 or some extensions.
   This is a great extension lab.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
### Background

#### Interface

The client interface is `checker_t:checker-interlace.h`.  The client gives us
a `checker_t` structure with four routines:
  1. `c->A()`, `c->B()`: the two routines to check.
  2. `c->init()`: initialize the state used by `A()` `B()`.   Calling this
      after running A() and B() should always set their data to the same
      initial values so that they are deterministic.

  3. `c->check()`: called after running `A(); B()`: returns 1
      if state was correct, 0 otherwise.  This routine uses code-specific
      knowlege to decide if the final state is correct.

A sequential execution would look like:

```
        // 1.  initialize the state.
        c->init(c);
        // 2. Call A(), run to completion.
        c->A(c);
        // 3. Call B(): should not fail b/c A() already finished
        if(!c->B(c))
            panic("B should not fail\n");
        // 4. check that the state passes.
        if(!c->check(c))
            panic("check failed sequentially: code is broken\n");
```

If this does not pass the code is very broken and we complain.

Assuming a single run passes, we can can put this block of code in a loop
(as our example code in `check-interleave.c:check` does) and run it multiple
times and should pass each time.  If it does not:
  1. `A()` or `B()` might be non-deterministic;
  2. `init()` might not reset the state correctly.
  3. `check()` might not check correctly.


#### Single stepping on the armv6 (review)

As you recall from last lab, single-stepping on the ARMv6 cpu we use
(arm1176) has two weird features:

  1. You won't get single-step faults unless running at user mode.
     Thus, we'll have to run A() at user level (the initial mode is
     SUPER).

  2. ARMv6 implements single-stepping by using a "mismatch fault" where
     you give a code address `addr` and the CPU will throw a mismatch
     fault when the pc is equal to an address that is not equal to `addr`.
     To single step A():

        - set the initial mismatch address to the first instruction of A.
        - start running at user level.
        - you'll get a fault: in the fault handler, get the address
          of the fault (the value of the pc register), set a mismatch on
          `pc`, and then jump back.
        - this will cause you to single-step through all the code.
    
     Note: the checked in code does this; you just need to modify   
     the base code.

#### Single stepping A()

The code in `check:check-interleave.c` gives an example of how
to run `A()` in single step mode (but without switching).  
This has several pieces:
  1. We need to install exception handlers:  the calls to `full_except_*`
     at the start of `check` do this.  This uses the code from 140e:
     you should be able to drop in your versions.
  2. We need to run A at user level in single stepping mode.  
     The call to `run_A_at_userlevel` does this.
  3. We need to set faults and handle them: `single_step_handler_full`
     does this.

What `run_A_at_userlevel` does:
  1. It creates a full register set (see `switchto.h:reg_t`) for A
     that can be switched into using `switchto_cswitch`.

     The register block `reg_t` is defined in `switchto.h` and is just
     17 words to hold the 16 general purpose registers (r0 in offset 0,
     r1 in offset 1, r15 --- the pc --- in offset 15) plus the cpsr
     (in offset 16).

  2. The arm has 16 general purpose registers and the process status
     word.  We use the CPSR of the current execution and just swap
     the mode.  We set PC (r15) to the address of A().  We set the
     stack pointer register sp to the end of a big array (stack
     grows down).   

     One tricky bit is that we set the return address register (lr)
     to the address of `A_terminated`: we do this so when A is done
     and returns it jumps to this routine and we can switch back into
     the checker.

     A second tricky bit is that `A_terminated` cannot just switch
     back to the original code b/c it is running at USER level so lacks
     permissions to switch back to `SUPER` (our original privileged mode).
     Thus it invokes a system call `sys_switchto(&start_regs)` which will
     cause a system call exception, (running in privileged mode) that will
     evantually calling the handler we registered `syscall_handler_full`.

  3. It turns on mismatching (single stepping).
  4. It then context switches from the current code to
     A() using `switchto_cswitch` (this is given; you built it in 140E).

  5. When A() is done and calls `A_terminated()` it will switch back
     using `start_regs`, which will turn off mismatch and return.

What `single_step_handler_full` does:
  1. It is passed in the full register set live when the code was
     interrupted.
  2. It verifies this was a single step fault.
  3. It then gets the pc, prints out a simple message.
  4. Resets the mismatch for the pc (so just that address will run)
  5. does a `switchto` to jump back to the exception code.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
### Part 0: turn off single-step when `A()` calls `A_terminated()`

If you compile and run the code you'll notice the single-step handler
prints a ton of instructions even though `A()` is tiny.  The reason for
this is that when A() exits, it jumps to `A_terminated()`:
  - If you look at `run_A_at_userlevel`  you can see how the 
    brain-surgery on the "thread" running A looks similar
    to your `rpi-thread.c` code.
  - The assignment of `A_terminated` to the `lr` register means that
    when `A()` returns it will automatically call `A_terminated`.
    This is similar to our exit hack in `rpi-thread.c`.

Your first simple hack should be to change the single step handler
to compare the `pc` value against `A_terminated()` and if equal, turn
single stepping off.  After doing so, the test output should do down
dramatically.

Easiest approach: 
  - change the Makefile to only run `tests/0-epsilon-test.c`.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
### Part 1: do a single switch from A() to B()

For this make sure your code handles all tests tests besides test 4.
Test 3 and 5 are reasonable; the others are trivial.  

Don't be afraid to add print statements (that you can easily disable)
to see which routine is running, and at what pc location.   You can add
to the tests as well.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
### Part 2:  make a `sys_trylock()` for test 4.

For this you'll add a system call that implements the try-lock needed for
test `4-trylock-ok-test.c`.    This is an example of a common pattern
we will do in the checker: implement a concurrency primitive using a
system call so that we (1) don't interrupt it with single-stepping and
(2) have a complete context for the blocking thread so we can yield from
one to another if needed.

(Note, this isn't the only way we can acheive these two goals.)

Adding a system call is pretty straightforward (you've done in several
labs).  The challenge for us is that we can only call system calls from
user-level not any privileged level (not fundamental --- this is just
b/c of how we've implemented the code).  The easiest hack to handle this
is problem is to just check which mode we are at, something like:

```
    // check-interleave.h
    static inline int sys_lock_try(volatile int *l) {
        // in rpi-inline-asm.h
        uint32_t cpsr = cpsr_get();
        
        // libpi/include/cpsr-util.h
        if(mode_get(cpsr) == USER_MODE)
            return syscall_invoke_asm(SYS_TRYLOCK, l);
        else
            todo("just call the trylock directly\n");
    }
```

This might be a good idea to just get things working.  However, all
extensions need a more general approach of multiple threads.  So you
should run `B()` as a second thread after the above works (or just skip
to using second thread immediately).

You can run B() as a seperate thread by:
 1. Adapt the the `run_A` code to create a second thread.  Note: b/c
    of armv6 restrictions make sure you are allocating the stack to be
    8-byte aligned.  You'll need to change the code so on exit it does
    the right thing for both the A and the B thread.

 2. Have a thread queue that you put the threads on and dequeue (as usual).
 3. Adapt your single step handler to use a `switchto` to the next thread
    rather than calling B() directly.
 4. For some code you wo't be able to run the sequential check as-is, so 
    either disable it, or make sure your threads can handle "running 
    sequentially".

This test is pretty dumb, so you probably should write another one.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
### Part 3:  make a `sys_yield()`.

For simplicity, our base checking system assumed it could call B() in
the exception handler and it would run to completion: i.e., it couldn't
yield back to `A()`  if the shared state was not ready (e.g., in the
case of a shared queue, if `B()` wanted to do a pop
and `A()` hadn't done a push yet).

Two lame consequences:
 1. Our base checker interface is a bit hacked in that it has
    B() return a failure if it can't make progress rather than yield
    and wait.
 2. As a result of (1) we check a dramatically smaller set of 
    interleavings than are possible --- e.g., we only run `B()`
    to completion when the shared state is completely setup.   This
    will cause us to miss errors.

So, fix this:
  1. Use the fact we have two threads (from part 2) to implement a new
     system call, `sys_yield()` so that B (and A) can yield to the
     other thread when it needs it additional work done before it can
     make progress.
  2. Write a test that shows your yield works as expected.
  3. Make copies and rewrite the tests so that they do yield rather 
     than have B() return an error.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
### Part 4: add some interesting tests.

Easy mode: get some "lock-free" code from GPT or Claude and check it.
Should be able to find some bugs.

More interesting: check gcc's synchonization library code.  The cool thing
about single-step is that we work just as well on machine code. (Though
it's harder to debug!).

Other possible: 
 - Rewrite circular to use compiler memory barriers and look for bugs.
 - Extend the checker to look for bugs in interrupt handlers.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
### Speed Extension (Recommended): only switch on memory operations.

Obviously the number of interleavings explodes with the number of
switches and/or code size.  Fortunately we can dramatically reduce
the interleavings we need to explore with the simple observation that
`A()` and `B()` can only effect each other if they do a memory or
synchronization operation.  Local modifications to their own registers
(e.g., an add, subtract, multiply, or branch) it can't affect the other.

Thus we only need to switch on memory or synchornization operations.
To do this you can decode the instruction that was interrupted and only
switch if it was a memory or sync operation.  You already have some idea
of how to decode instructions from the JIT labs: in our case we don't
need to know the exact instruction, just that it does memory.

To help this I checked in a new header (`code/is-mem.h`) for determining if a 
instruction is a load or a store.  (If you also handle synchronization
operations, you'd have to add them.)  

It's possible that switching before each memory operation should be
enough, but you should have a correctness argument for your approach.

There's a bunch of tweaks you can do:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
### Other Extensions

There's an enormous number of extensions:
  - Extend the code to do 2 switches, 3 switches, etc.

  - Make the error handling better.  E.g., on the unix side,
    use `addr2line` to convert the code addresses we ran on to line numbers.


  - Speed: the number of paths grows exponentially with the number of
    switches.  The standard way to handle this is to hash the memory
    state and if you get to the same program point with the same state,
    prune execution.

    As a crude method you could side-step the need to know what memory
    locations are being read or written by hashing the register set for
    each thread and prune when the remaining context switches are  the
    same (or fewer) than a previous state.
